Conclusions: Impact of Length of Stay on Mental Health of International Students

The study examined the relationship between length of stay and mental health indicators among international students. Based on SQL analysis of diagnostic scores from PHQ-9 (depression), SCS (social connectedness), and ASISS (acculturative stress), several key insights emerged:

Key Findings

International students with shorter stays (1-3 years) experience higher mental health difficulties:

Their depression scores (PHQ-9) are higher.

Acculturative stress (ASISS) is highest, indicating significant challenges in adapting to a new culture.

Social connectedness (SCS) is lower, reflecting difficulties in forming social bonds.

Longer stays (6+ years) correlate with improved mental health outcomes:

Depression and acculturative stress scores decrease over time.

Social connectedness improves, suggesting better integration into the host culture.

The first few years are the most critical for mental well-being:

Early-stage international students are more vulnerable to psychological distress.

Institutions should enhance mental health support programs targeting newly arrived students.

Social connectedness plays a crucial role in adaptation:

Higher SCS scores are associated with better psychological well-being.

Universities should promote peer support programs, cultural exchange events, and mentorship initiatives to help international students integrate.

üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations

Early mental health interventions: Universities should provide counseling and peer mentoring programs for new international students.

Cultural adaptation workshops: Organizing language and cultural orientation programs can ease the acculturation process.

Community-building initiatives: Encouraging student participation in clubs, organizations, and social activities can strengthen social support networks.

Further research: Expanding the dataset to include different countries and academic institutions can provide broader insights into international student mental health trends.
